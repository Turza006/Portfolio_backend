          I'm a passionate backend developer with a strong background in creating robust and scalable web applications.
          My journey in the world of coding started 4 years ago, and since then, I've been constantly learning and
          improving my skills to stay at the forefront of technology.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          My expertise lies in Node.js, MongoDB, Express, and Nest.js, with a strong command over TypeScript and JavaScript.
          I'm also well-versed in AWS services and have experience in developing both REST APIs and GraphQL endpoints.
          I'm always excited about taking on new challenges and contributing to innovative projects.
